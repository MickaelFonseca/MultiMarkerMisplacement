Code works on PC-12963 (HUG)	

	REQUIREMENTS:
- written in Python 2.7
- glob
- os
- sys
- numpy : 1.16.4
- matplotlib : 2.2.3
- yaml : 5.1.1
- btk : 2.0.11
- csv : 1.0
- itertools
- pyCGM2_CGM11 : 3.1.5 (march 2019)


	IN CURRENT FOLDER:
- c3d files to compute

- Definition; MAIN_Misplacement; Misplacement; Point_Manipulation; pyCGM_modelling; Rotation_Matrix; Simplify_acq; UserSettings; Write_Result_File; Analysis

- CGM1_1.userSettings

- command_file.txt or command_file_Della_Croce.txt


	COMMAND FILES DETAILS:
command files : definition of markers and errors to misplace
if both command files, will apply only command_file.txt
	COMMAND_FILE.TXT: all markers the same errors around a circle. Can apply several magnitudes. 
Angles 0 pelvis : local direction Y
Angle 0 femur + tibia + ankle : local directions -X (posterior)
Angle 0 foot : local direction Y (lateral)
other angles: in trigonometric direction from position 0.

command_file_Della_Croce.txt: errors personalized for each directions of each markers (values based on Della Croce and al. 1999.)


	MAIN_Misplacement DETAILS:
0. Perparation of c3d files, variables(markers, misplacements), path
	Get markers to misplace and combinaison of errors
	Get all static and dynamic files
	Creation of .txt file with simulation number and combinaison of marker positions associated
FOR EACH PATIENT :
	1.get simple c3d files and reference
		Simplifie static and dynamic files 
		pyCGM computation for original positions
		Get initial pyCGM angles (reference)
		Store misplaced angles in csv files		
	2.FOR EACH combinaison of misplacement: computation of simulations
		Creation of new files, new file names
		Misplace markers
		Remove virtual markers to compute them again from misplaced marker set
		pyCGM computation
		Get new angles 
		Store new angles in csv files (possible to get 15000 files per folder: uncomment l.137->139 and 211->215)
	3.Analysis of results
		
	
	FURTHER DETAILS: 
- can run several patients successively.
1 dynamic and 1 static file per patient.

- only need to run MAIN_Misplacement.
